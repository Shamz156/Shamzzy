            <p class="animation-description" style="text-align: left;">
                This animation tells the powerful story of a skeleton, exploring the themes of self-love and resilience. 
                The narrative delves into the idea that we shouldn‚Äôt expect love to always come from others, but rather, 
                we should learn to love and accept ourselves, even when the world feels like it‚Äôs turning against us. 
                Through the skeleton‚Äôs journey, the animation portrays the emotional struggles of facing dark times and 
                the importance of finding strength within.
    
                Created using Adobe After Effects and InDesign as part of my Narrative and Sequence module, this project allowed 
                me to explore the process of storyboarding and creating an animatic, which guided the flow of the animation and 
                its visual storytelling. It‚Äôs a personal reflection on self-empowerment, reminding viewers that true love begins from within.

            <p class="animation-description">
            This animatic is a draft version of my final animation, created as part of the Narrative & Sequence module.
             I began by sketching frames by hand and then assembling them in Adobe Premiere Pro to refine the pacing, 
             transitions, and storytelling. 

             The animatic helped me identify mistakes and make adjustments before moving on to the full animation in 
             Adobe After Effects and InDesign. This step was crucial in ensuring the final piece effectively conveys 
             its themes of self-love, resilience, and personal growth.

    <p class="project-description">
        This piece explores the theme of time through a personal and heartfelt approach. 
        For this project, I documented the growth of my niece by capturing a series of photographs 
        of her hands and feet from birth to the age of two. This transformation visually represents 
        the passage of time, highlighting the beauty of growth and change. Through this work, I aimed 
        to create a meaningful narrative that reflects the fleeting yet precious nature of early childhood.

        <h2 class="title">Interdisciplinary ‚Äì Bootlegging</h2>
        <p class="inter-description">
            For this project, we explored the use of Augmented Reality (AR) to engage with and edit physical artifacts.
            The goal was to select an artifact from the Bishopsgate Institute's collection and creatively interact with
            it using AR tools. My chosen artifact was Backstreet by Guy Burch, which is associated with the history of
            a gay fetish club. Inspired by the themes of this iconic piece, I decided to integrate a gay fetish symbol
            into the AR experience. This symbol embodies the cultural significance of the space, representing not just
            a physical club but also a space of expression, identity, and community within the LGBTQ+ culture. By
            applying AR editing techniques, I was able to transform the artifact's original context, blending the
            historical significance of the piece with modern interpretations of sexuality and identity.

        <p class="animation-description" style="text-align: left;">
            This is a recreated and bootlegged version of a scene from Top Boy where Cam gets kidnapped. As part of our project, 
            we reimagined the scene by casting an all-female lineup, adding a unique twist to the original. Through this process, 
            we explored the use of color gradients to enhance mood and atmosphere while experimenting with different camera angles 
            to create visual tension and storytelling depth. This exercise allowed us to develop a deeper understanding of cinematography 
            techniques while pushing creative boundaries in reinterpretation.
